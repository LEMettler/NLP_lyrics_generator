(One, Two, Three, Four...)\#
In the night of fire\#Baby turn me round, I'm crazy ay-ay-ay-ay\#Turn the music higher\#Push it up and down my baby\#Up and down\#
I feel so glad in the night\#Kiss me now, kiss me right\#You give me all of my desire (higher)\#I feel so mad in the dark\#Come on and break into my heart\#
Campus Summit\#Baby don't give up on fire (fire)\#Mad desire\#Campus Summit\#Everybody's waiting for me\#Dance into the night\#And you're gonna be alright\#
Push me to the good sound\#Take me all around my baby ay-ay-ay-ay\#Turn thee music louder\#Pump it up and down\#Get crazy\#Up and down
