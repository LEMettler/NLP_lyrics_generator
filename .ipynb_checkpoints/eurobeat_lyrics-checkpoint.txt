Lost in my reaction
Dancing like a Parapara star in Japan
My name is like a thunder
Baby, you can feel in danger
Bad illusion, hot confusion
Dancing all night

Eurobeat is over the top
I'm gonna excite tonight
Feel all right
I play the music on the fire
Eurobeat I'm singing for you
Will be the power of the night

Bazooka bazooka bazooka girl
I wanna rock the nation, baby
Boom boom fire!
Bazooka bazooka bazooka girl
You break into the rhythm, Japanese desire
Take me into the beat of the light
Dancing with bazooka girl

You can feel the power
Tokyo people, take me higher
Like a bad desire
Number one in Japan
I need a big emotion
On the stage you feel vibration
Burning to the music
Baby kiss me right now
;
Because I run away
Like an emotion wanna make it on my way
I Need you, I feel you
Tonight I wanna shout
I am so funny, all the night I'm screaming loud 
Without your money I feel so blue
I catch your money because I'm bad, boy
My silver blood's burning up for you
Crazy fun, number one, music for my gun

Caballero With Sombrero
Shake me like a go-go
Baila baila pistolero
Night is crazy, oh-oh
Caballero With Sombereo
Dancing like a yo-yo
Caballero stand, baby come on round 'n round 

I kiss you, I miss you
I go too far away
Like a cowboy I wanna leave it on my way
I need you, I feel you
Until my love is out
I need your body, when you shock I'm screaming loud
;
(One, Two, Three, Four...)

In the night of fire
Baby turn me round, I'm crazy ay-ay-ay-ay
Turn the music higher
Push it up and down my baby
Up and down

I feel so glad in the night
Kiss me now, kiss me right
You give me all of my desire (higher)
I feel so mad in the dark
Come on and break into my heart

Campus Summit
Baby don't give up on fire (fire)
Mad desire
Campus Summit
Everybody's waiting for me
Dance into the night
And you're gonna be alright

Push me to the good sound
Take me all around my baby ay-ay-ay-ay
Turn thee music louder
Pump it up and down
Get crazy
Up and down
