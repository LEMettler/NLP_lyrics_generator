Baby's so bad
;I will leave a part of me across the sea

Take your time and tell me if your love is still deep

I can tell you that my desire is forever
Sleeping with the little pink fluffy bear you
gave to me
I pretend I'm holding you

But if you call, but if you call me to say hi
I'm gonna say goodbye and hold it, hold it tight

All night on the phone far away from home
Just to send you a kiss again say your name
;I don't want another

All the things around me that keep to remind me
Every ittle moment passed next to you

To make you believe in all I say
But if you feel like I feel it's true
Say you wanna come back to me

Every time you go
I'm alone with my desire, I just can't get enough of you
Every time you go

Every time you go
I'm afraid to watch you leaving, I pray to never let you go
Every time you go
When you think I'm only sleeping, I can hear you speaking

My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said I did my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive

This is one for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down

Rolling Srones
Filled the magic seventies
With a wonder war
Full of music and crazy emotion

Walk alone
In the night along a bridge
Telling "yes" or "no"
I will back into my world
;In to my life
Friday evening I'm so glad
Around my side

I like harmony, and sensuality
Walking around the days of week

My only sin, a tractor beam
Is in my pretty face

And for people of my hometown
My life is a playground and it makes me
Wonder why I don't dare to fade with no trace

But leaves a sign

Down down deep into me
So more than before
I feel to grow
A tiny voice, that goes...

Runaway and never looking back...
... Find a place where you can leave a track
Runaway voices say
Make your deepest wishes come true

They say due to such a beauty
She won't do her duties
And it makes me anger coz' I'm tender
And can be more
;We got so excited
I remember last time when I
Got crazy

Looking over the crowd
I could see them havin' fun
When the music and the cars
Met together and the girls
Were dancing

Shining car of your dreams
Show me the way for lovin'
Amazing cars and cute girls
Automesse just for you

Looking forward to go once again
To be there for dreaming
Can imagine how many friends will be there
;And command me
And then leave me
So don't think you can 'cos you know that I could
Never stand it so believe me

Night out so believe me
;You need a little love
To warm your soul

To understand

Everytime you don't call me at all
My heart is alone and sad
;Hear the moonlight scream the stars away
Follow me in my horror fantasy
Open that door and meet the night creatures

Shakin' all your body, rattle in the night
Dancin' to the rhythm of my rusty chain
Reachin' to the limit, now you're terrorised
Howlin' to the beat say you can start to play

Everybody's runnin'
Everybody's screamin'
Everybody's raisin' hell
Nowhere is a hidin'
No key to be turnin'
Can you lend a bone to the fun?

Horror fantasy
Fantasy
You can never be safe from this
Horror fantasy - fantasy
We're dancin' to the beat of nightmares
Horror fantasy
Fantasy
You can never be safe from this
Horror fantasy - fantasy
We're dancin' to the beat of nightmares!

Squeakin' up your fears into the crazy gate
Can you feel your heartbeat like a railway now?
Spooky little creature rockin'in the night
You can find your feet are movin' right in time
;I got a feeling deep inside my heart
Gotta believe it
Everyday
I try to be powerful
Ain't too easy

Do you remember when I call your name
How do you feel babe
It's your time
Now or never you'll be mine
It's so easy
;Makes your body fall apart
All you're left with is your bed and your desire

And all you need
Is just some kind of movement
Moving 'till the end of this night
Movin' up your body and your mind

Come on now

Shake it up
Shake your little body
Come on my buddy
Shake it right now
Shake it up

Too strong to understand

It cannot be that bad"
Don't you try to stop me baby
Ever to be so sad
;High & dry... I'm not so bad! Oh babe

Get you up and make my day
'Cause I'm hungry now, wanna show you how...

Get another chance to drive me wild
'Cause I want to freak out with you, my babe
Get another chance to love

What's come over you?
I want to drive around the town... I'd like it!
In you get! Unless you want to
Stand me up again...
;Having some fun with him
I felt alone well it's not a crime
And I'm not going to blame myself

I checked my heart in order to make sure I won't find any love
So I've decided and I said it

Walk a mile in my shoes
Load the fire of values
Then you'll know the feelings

Just another day without you
Baby please don't go away from me I'm a part of you
Everytime I think of you... in the night
My feelings go down, until you come
;To stir and kid me a long
A long like never seen

I didn't do anything to stop
"The mountain is there!
It's waiting for you"

Oh yes, oh baby you believe me
What a night, I'll be wild
And you go on, go to stir me

Went on to pick at my time

I wanna hope you'll be mine
You wanna hope I will cry
The mountain's waiting
;Estimate ability
To run after you
Be tainted by you
And throw myself away

'Cause I'm feeling that passion everyday
'cause my memory runs at yesterday
And now's the time
To make you mine again
You'll play a dangerous game

Because I'm bad tonight
You riding on my rockey
I feel O.K.
No matter what you say
Because I'm bad tonight
I'll push you through the limits
I don't wanna know if it's wrong or it's right

Overcome the handicap
Hanging from your fingertips
I know what it takes
Being caught in your wake
That blows myself away
;Anything doesn't get me exciting bride

Lay on me your body to say
Body language and talking with my heart

Love me night and day
Love me so much, my honey
And the dark
Never will be so dark
Night and day
Baby, love me till morning

And we shake the love tonight
BABY, KISS ME ALL NIGHT, all day forever
Never change again your way

Lay on me the heat of your blow
Anything cannot warm me up all night

Lay on me your cheeks, on my own
Never leave, never say to me "good-bye"
;with the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound by the sound of his feet
machine guns ready to go
Are you, Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along
without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
and kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
you can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
reapeating the sound of the beat
No more
;A venom for my heart, venom for my heart
Moving to the disco for an hour blissful
Turning the poewr on, turn a power on

I want my life to get hot
I want my darling to rock
I want to wake up screaming loud
Wow! Wow!

A prayer to the "Master Power"
The wave in me to make it make it my own
Please get me to your crest and higher
So I can drop and ride it ride it alone

Hungry for a new life with the devil to dice
Well I'm in for the kill, I'm in for the kill
As another day comes, as another rain falls
I hope to rise above the the mass

But I was too young to understand
He kissed and hugged me
But he had another
A girl saying he's her man

You know what?
I think I will leave him and go back home
I think I will leave him to be alone
I made up my mind yes I'm going home

There's only a way for me
To wake up from this dream
But I am sure that you
Will disagree

The game we play it is dangerous
To be or notta be
On the river of emptiness
I'm waiting just for your moves
The game we play is my loneliness
To be or notta be
So far away is my happiness
So far to my world... honey

To be or notta be
She's gonna say to me
"I wanna move the groove inside your soul"

And turn it on
(I've) gotta find the way to fly
...Uououh

I'm waiting for you the moon is bright
Tonite
It's all over
Feel me, call me
Get up 'n live your life and hold me
;My baby, Baby blue for you, my baby just can I do
Baby blue, Baby blue, yes I'm Baby blue for you
My lover, Baby blue for you my lover, slavin' to you

Don't you know I'm loving our body
You could change the life on fire
Holdin' me, do but tell me you'll wait
I'm waiting you to lose in my destiny

Take my gum, ah, I won't play
Take my gum, you can take my affections,
Take my gum, ah, I won't play
I keep movin' on 'till the night is gone

Take my gum, ah...

Holdin' me, do but tell me you'll wait
I'm waiting to lose in my destiny

(Chorus)

Take my gum, ah...
;Got to start my day
Hopped into my little red car
Off to work I fly
I've got such a boring life
Want to let the world go by
I don't even want to try
Stoned again don't give a damn

Fly up in the sky so high
Burning got to set my life on fire
Flying up in the sky so high
Got to live got to give

Feel good still got a life
Loving everyday
Get up all by myself
The birds are singing gay
I've got such a brand new start
Finally found my way out right
God blessed me with more than this
More than this more than this
;I can meet you everytime I need you

Babbling about my weakness
People urge on me to follow you, babe
Keep me

Under your wing
Feel the wind on my skin
Come on boy, the wheel of fortune
Stopped for my heart
Under your gaze
Feel the beating to share
Count on you, my brother
Staring your face

Wings of fire
Go back to shine
As you did it when the lightning sparked
Higher
Wings of fire
Go back to shine
Lead me to dawn, when the youth was in me

Meeting you with stillness
I remember what you did for us, guy
;With your hot kiss
I'm looking for a lover so hard

Kill be baby
With your red lips
I'm searching for a criminal heart

If you want to get my love my desire
Like a killer catch his victim from life
Play a bang bang match of fire - guns
I'm a burgler who always runs

Gangster of love for a hard vibration
Gangster of dirty soul
Gangster of love
Criminal sensation that lives inside me

Gangster of destiny

Driving crazy
In the big street
I'm running out of bank of your love

Like a danger
Dirty angel
I'm really just got out of control
;You never happen to be with me, honey
Try to relax and let me feel
The magic moment that I'm loooking for long

Just get ready
It's so easy
And don't forget: don't wait for tomorrow
It's so funny
Don't be silly tonight

You better shake me up tonight
It's your time to believe
Anyway I'm loving free
And shake me up all night 'Cause I want you to be...
Let your body lay on me

Try to remember what you got
And follow me, 'cause I give you a good time
Don't be alone and move your head
The time is coming for me and for you man
;Thinking only about the same
Money money and nothing else
This is our life

Only dollars in your mind
Business keeps your soul alive
But sometimes you need to love somebody

I wanna stay in the middle of your heart
I wanna fill where before there was a black hole
I wanna be like a shining shining star
Hey look it in the sky

Let your body rock tonight
Let your body rock, come on and do it
Let your body rock tonight
The game is over, you can't stop this love, hey hey
Let your body rock tonight
Let your body rock, come on and do it
Let your body rock tonight
The game is over, you can't stop this love, hey hey

You are living night and day
Thinking only about the same
Money money and nothing else
This is your life

But the life is something more
What is right is not the wrong
You can take another chance, please do it!
;Until you ran away
Now I'm lost in you heart
And crying now
Feel the tears rolling down
You tried to get away
So baby please let me know

Alone anymore

I can't conceal my secret needs
How can I saw my dream is over
When a bell will call me gonna be my dear mister right

And when I fall in love
Will stop the rain and the pain
And when I fall in love you will know
And when I fall in love
No one to blame no more shame
And when I fall in love it will grow

Every night every day
I look for love at first sight
Every time every way
My heart is look for a light
;Everybody come on
To see a beautiful spring along
Hot and cold on my own

Time free yourself from the time
Growing deep in your mind

Time
There is no time
To take another chance
There is no time to live a new romance
It passes quickly seems to fly

Burnin' up this rebel soul

Runaway, deep in the heart of thunder
Not for sale, so gotta run for cover
Runaway, this is no time for lovers
Come tomorrow, gotta keep on movin'

Runaway, deep in the heart of thunder
Not for sale, I'd better run for shelter
Runaway, this is no time to wonder
Come tomorrow, gotta keep on movin'

With you man, get ready!


I feel the light, where ever we go
Being together, walking around the world
You won't regret, you're not alone
Just give me one good reason


You really are the man I love
And I just want to be your girl
When you're feeling happy I know
I'll come back to you
You give me more then I dream


You really are the man I love
I just want to help you boy
And you wan't be sorry again
You belong to me
I want to hear you say "Girl I love you"


Boy you know I really love you
Right now you believe me
Don't you see the hurt in my heart
The power of lovin'
;I've found a little treasure
I did not expect to find my way to happiness

Listen to my calling
Listen to the things I say
Let the message take off
Let me say it clear

"Baby be happy because I love you"
Nobody else as much as I do
I realized it after a sleepless night
Come on! Come on!
"Baby be happy because I love you"
Nobody knows it as well as I do
And it's today that I decide
To let you know
You know? I love you!

It's the best surprise of my whole life
A present in the morning
I look at myself the mirror plays the biggest smile
;And another common day is passing
Thru the morning falls
Into the night and nothing changes

The revolution is up to you
Get down to live another life
The hidden force that gets you thru
The dark until you find it

White light all around
I know you see the white light
Sun shine deep insi-ide
And ev'rybody's gonna see you're right
There is a white light all around
I know you see the white lighte
Sun shine deep insi-ide
And ev'rybody's see you're all right

So you can be free
If you find a way to reach your heaven
Where the light will be
Over again so you can go now
;I know, and you know it too
No no don't be cool
I can work on your night
And turn it to fine
Trust me, trust me now


I'll be your hate
If you dance rock n' roll
If you dance till the morning comes
I'll be your rate
Jumping up and down like a ball


Dancer
Now I need it, now I'm coming I'm a
Dancer
Hey watch my body then move
To move it up all day, all night and everything
Just move it up, I feel it with the people


Hey this is gonna be a hard days night
And I know it too
No no don't be cool
I can see through the dark
And turn it to light
Trust me, trust me now

;The people go on
And I can listen to my songs
They are in my mind
The beat of my life

;Maybe September
Walking around midnight
You said "I'll love you till the end"
Never again I want to believe you

Tomorrow you'll be so faraway
And (you'll) leave me for long time
You said "I'm gonna call"
But no-one is ringin' up tonight .....

No reply ! a broken illusion
In my heart ... I'm feeling lonely
One more time a broken illusion
Even now you don't wanna love me !!

Have you forgotten ?
"Love is forever"
Why did you tell me this ?
Do you understand my misery ?
Baby, give up to play with my feeling
;With a beautiful lovely prince
Together lost and high in the sky
Power and glory in a magic stoned castle tonight
The legend of two broken hearts

It's a lovely season
And the air is full of magic and funny love
No more time and no more reasons
Will stop all the passion inside my soul

Wonderful
My love emotion
Baby take me now to your life in extasy
Wonderful
Full of devotion
Look around and c'mon with me tonight
Wonderful
It's like an ocean
All the really passion inside my lonely life
Wonderful
Full of devotion
Look around and c'mon with me tonight

I dream a vision
With a rising sun in the sky
The moon the planets a magical night
The light of rainbow in the middle of a beautiful day
Your love around, my only way
;If you feel lonely more than ever
Just look into your heart
You can find the decision to starting over

And there's a lesson that I've learnt
The only truth among all lies
You better look for love
Following just your heart and not just your eyes

I know I won't give up
And no matter how much my eyes have cried
I'll always going on
'Cause I want a life that's worthy to live

I'm looking for love.- I'm looking for love
I'll never gonna stop the searching
'Cause I'm looking for love - I'm looking for love
And it will be tough 'Cause I'm too dreaming
Will be hard 'cause I'm so defensive

It's time to go now my dear friend
It's time for you to take your way
I'll keep you in my heart
Hoping that you will find the right love one day
;Sad and alone ev'rything gone
Then he felt a bang bang like a fire in the light
And a mirage coming to life was

Shining burning :
" Tell me what you did and I'll forgive you"
"I was bad to ev'ryone to love
I just want to change my life now"

Nightmare in the city

Don't you worry it's gonna help you
Nightmare in the city

Maybe tonight will be your time
You'll be feeling bang bang like a blasting in the night
And the mirage suddenly will be
;You're with me

Just to make you love me like a mad
But if you look inside my eyes
You can see that those will be only

Promises that I cannot keep

All the promises that I made to you
Were all lies uh oh uh

Promises that today are gone
I've a fallen king so deeply lone
All the promises that I made to you

;Here we are, trying hard to save our soul
So here we are, feeling nothing can stop this war
Fighting, running, kicking people to the floor

But sometime's hard to say if we are losing, winning
How can you tell?
Be right or wrong
Reality seems to be made up of
Differend shades of grey

Life is...

Black or white
You have to choose your side
We will fight
No matter if it's
Wrong or right
We'll ride the lighting
Day and night
Until we will be winning

Here we are, feeling right on top of the world
Here we are, feeling mean right to the core
So here we are, asking for an end to this war
Hear the enemy is knocking on the door
;In a golden room
Make me sweet
I'm your candy moon
Just illusion
Big confusion in my heart

Make me high
Looking for a lovely night

Touch me now and kiss me tender
Tonight

When the sun goes down I can feel the
Smell and sound of a music play

Hot girls in that building and naked bodies
Too much and my brain goes boom

Waitin' for the sun
Now I believe I made an error
And it's time to run
;Not the way you walk
Your eyes got something that makes me feel good

You've got to know they're so clear and bright
They seem keep on calling on my name
And it's not the color of your hair
That will keep me sleepless into my bed

Everytime you will step in my life
I will gonna stay up late
'Till the morning
Everytime you will take me so high

So so long good-bye my baby
I'll carry on with this empty broken heart
So so long good-bye my lady
My life goes on with this emptiness
That I can't confess

Just can't get enough
You should satisfy my deep desires
Just can't get a touch
Your skin was a flame that set my heart on fire

You just broke up my life in two
And now I am confused
And my doubts gonna burn my skin
Ain't that a crime and whose the pain

Take your chance now

Dream on dream - Sing for the laughter
Dream on dream on - Sing it just for the tears
Everybody needs something to die for
Dream on dream - You got to lose or win today

Dream on dream - Sing as a fighter
Dream on dream on - Sing it just for the year
Everybody needs something to live for
Dream on dream - Dream on until your dreams will come true

Everytime I look myself
I could be somebody else
But it's everybody sin
You want to win make you life a dream

You gotta make her feel it
Tell her she's a lady
Which is making you feeling right
And so you can believe it

Coming back into my life
Somebody's dancing for me
Everywhere I feel a universe around

Big bang rocking away
You can feel again into ya baby
Big bang I wanna say
Going down falling down no more
Big bang rocking away
You can feel again into ya baby
Big bang I wanna say
Like a universe born from love's big bang

Nothing can be better
Nothing when I'm playing with you
I'm gonna feel the power
I can be a thunder
I can fly again in the blue
You see my heart is freedom
;Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas, think of snow
Think of sleigh, bells, and off you go
Like reindeer in the sky
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly!

Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake
You'll see her wink her eye
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly!

Up you go with a heigh and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Neverland waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dreams that you dream will come true

When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares good-bye
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly!
;When I was a young warthog
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the savannah after ev'ry meal
I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt my friends never stood downwind

And, oh, the shame
Thoughta changin' my name
And I got downhearted
Ev'rytime that I...

Saw the sights around times Square
She met the Mets and met the mayour
They were thrilled that the girl was there

They were glad she's "in the house"
The whole world just adores her
And her name is Minnie Mouse
They all love that Minnie Mouse

;Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart

And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy
So was I
When she loved me

Through the summer
And the fall
We had each other
That was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be

And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew
That she loved me

So the years went by
I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone

Still I waited for the day
When she'd say I will always
Love you

Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
And she smiled at me and held me
Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me

When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives withint my heart
When she loved me

;When the stars assume their patterns
And the day has made his journey
To the life we knew
Before the world changed
When not a thing I held was true
But you were kind to me
And you reminded me

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We could be lost we could refuse to try
But you made it through
In the dark night
Who would those lucky guys turn out to be?
But that unusual blend
Of my funny friend and me

That the world is not my playground
There are other things that matter
What is simple needs protecting
My illusions all would shatter

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We could be lost we could refuse to try

But you stayed in my corner
When the only world I knew was upside down
And now the world and me
Know you carried me

I'm not as clever as I thought I was
I'm not the boy I used to be because
You showed me something different
You showed me something pure
I always seemed so certain
But I was really never sure
But you stayed
And you called my name
When others would have walked out on
A lousy game
And look who made it through
But your funny friend and you

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
That tiny planet and the bigger guy
I don't know wheter I should laugh or cry

Just like the patterns in the big sky
We'll be together 'til the end this time
Don't know the answer or the reason why
We'll stick together 'til the day we die

If I had to do this all a second time
I won't complain or make a fuss
Who would the angels send?
But that unlikely blend
Of those two funny friends
That's us

;What I should do, with my destiny
You don't say what I could do with my life

Do it the way I am

Say bye bye to the baby, I want to be free
And this time I wanna go freak forever
Bye to the baby, I want to be me
Dancing on and on to the eurobeat

Don't say who I'm supposed to see
Where I should go and the way I'd feel
You don't say who I could kiss in the night
How am I supposed to know whose Mr. Right
;You and me, let's just be honest
We're gonna run, nothing can stop us
Even the night that falls all around us

Soon there will be laughter and voices
Beyond the clouds over the mountains
We'll run away on roads that are empty
Lights from the airfield shining upon you

Nothing can stop this, not now I love you
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
Nothing can stop this, not now I love you
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us

Not gonna get us
Not gonna get us

We'll run away, keep everything simple
Night will come down, our guardian angel
We rush ahead, the crossroads are empty
Our spirits rise, they're not gonna get us

My love for you, always forever
Just you and me, all else is nothing
Not going back, not going back there
They don't understand
They don't understand us

Not gonna get us
Not gonna get us
;But my heart is closing for you now
I want to see you with your knees on the floor
You will pay all your mistakes somehow

You you're the only one it's true
You will make me stronger
You you will know that I'll be there
Stay a little closer

Love is a lite
It's the meaning I've been always looking for
Love is a lite
If you need me now you gotta pray, gotta pray
Love is a lite it's a guide into the darkness of the world
Love is a lite
Like a sun into a winter night, it's all right

I heard you calling me last night on the phone
But you better quite the games you play
You took your love away you left me alone
And I won't be crying for you again
You open your eyes and see
There's something to remember
You, you will know that I'll be there
Stay a little closer
;Wondering when I'll meet my mate
Searching the sky trin' to find the reason why
But tonite I'll take my chance

It will be something special
A night I'll never forget
You will be my dream loverboy
Come in my arms babe now

You gonna be the love of my life
I'll get you, boy
'Cause it's written in the stars

So many times I've been standing on my own
Waiting for my prince to come
Then when you came I have stared to live again
You have washed away my blue
;Night by night I'm feeling like a top
You are my passion, I feel your satisfaction
You want the rhythm, the rhythm of my heart

Wonder why, take a look in my obsession
Yes alright, I'm losing control
One more time feel like a ballet dancer
Move to the music forever and together

Rasputin, I'm burning up on fire
Pasternak, the king of masterpieces
Molotov, I'm gonna be a sex bomb
Tell me why I'm out of my control

Shake the night, my only night in Moscow
Make me feel a king in Russian land
Like a vibration you'll go to be a temptation
You are the rhythm, you're like a rolling stone
;In this hopeless cruel cruel world
Out in the blue there'll be nothing to loose
When we'll sacrifice your soul

I just wanna be the one for you
I just wanna be the one who loves you
Time is changing but we'll never do
You're

All that I want
And there's nothing you can tell me
Fever in this blood of a loving man
You're
All that I want
I can feel the love you give me
Baby now you gotta understand
All that I want

Light up a candle and you will remember
That fire is your love
Life is a danger and love is a stranger
But stronger is my soul
;Looking for what's behind
My imagination's full
Not knowing what I'll find

Destiny calls build up the walls
Don't wanna start to climb
Cause I am standing tall
I can see what I like

Crazy as it may be
Isn't it crazy
Gotta be wary
Got this thing inside of me
Pulling me to the core
And chilling me

Here I am finally I see the light
There's so much I have to do it's miracle days
Devil's dancing good I know way
Hold on with all you got
Here I am it's not the end of my life
There's too much I need to say
Don't give it away
Angel's singing my love is bringing
This is a brand new day

How could this be it happened to me
Time is still on my side
I've nowhere else to go
So I will still live my life
;Nobody's lover
Let's make a bet, 'cos life is winning or losing

You climbed the stairs to heaven
But you may never climb up these stairs again
You though you'd be forgiven

Last night I was pretending to sleep
It was late in the night
A scent of woman all over you
What's you're putting me through
;Wasn't hard to find
Did you know that nothing ever
Could have kept you away from me

Now I can tell you babe
Nothing has changed today
Opening inside my heart
So don't you cry for me
Everything is alright it's alright

One day in another time and place
We'll be leaving back today
And we'll be together baby
Easy to say

One day when the sun blows out of the rain
And the shadows only fade then forever
You'll find me, find me the way one day

Can't you see that my love my baby
Is gonna stay with you
Can't you see that all we need is
Walking across the bridge

Tell me baby, are you ready to fly high...?
When you need me look in my eyes
'Cause I got a call for you
;Just stop it I had enough of you
And I'm not your property anymore
You might think that I won't make it, on my own

Now it's nothing but my way
'Cause I'm ready to go
And my future is today
You belong to yesterday

'Cause now I'm stronger
There's nothing that you can do
Or that you can say to me
Sometimes I wonder
If I need to love somebody
Or better off alone

'Cause now I'm stronger
There's nothing that I will let you say
Just to stop me now
Sometimes I wonder
I don't need anybody better alone
And on my own

Hush
I used to go with the flow, with you
I didn't really care much of me
You might think that I can't take it, but you're wrong
;It's your time to celebrate tonight
Do you believe me?

Even for longer
I would love to get away with you
;Gonna leave you on your own

To forgive my sin of love
Over and over again
I wanna tell you

Never forget my love
Every recall
For I guess you're losing even my heart
Baby never forget my love
Never again
'Cause I know you're lonely even tonight

Have you begun to built your life
Wanna teach you how to fly
Without my love
Could you be alive again

Tonight you're killing me softly with your feelings
Oh baby can't see?
Killing my love

Every time, I search your passion
Every night give me an illusion
Need to set my eyes on you to feel all right
;All my heart given to that one
Now you're gone and I just can't go on

Lonely days here without you by my side
I feel so lonely I could cry
If only you could come back here and make things right

Lonely night to dream about you
Lonely night without your love
Holding on to break up sadness and survive
Lonely night made of desire
Lonely night I'm in my own
Desperately wanting you break here for me

Where are you? I'm trying to reach you
I feel so blue, 'cause I cannot touch you
In my life I never felt this way
;Right thru the sky you're dancin'
I see you move
The music is so groovy

The way I keep on movin'
And dancin' around

To let you know

;Sake and lies,running in the fire
Girls in the clubs
Having a price, selling paradise

Dream and love then
Fight and die for power trip, time is over
Crime and law then
Right or wrong you'll feel the wave, hitting the night

When the tsunami comes
Feel a crack in the house
Killing one, two baby

You got nothing to loose
Screaming one, two maybe

And you will find a new way
Never be sorry I will be here to stay

Shows you what to do

I don't want to hurt you 'cause I can't apologize

I have used the power that is proper for my breed
I've abused man, I had them crawling at my feet
I have bit the apple with no guilt inside my mind
Thinking that to sin was the sweetest juice of life

I have done wrong and I'm ready to pay for my sins
I'll redeem myself for all the mes that I have been
Situations's hurling down and now I need control
Situation calls you more and more

I will never let those evil games recapture me
Because I can't do more than confess the evidence

I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love

Got to cleanse myself, just before it ends
Baby help me, just forgive me for the way I am
I need to be clean, to prevent to sin
Keep my hands out of the cookie jar, know what I mean

I will turn to good, join the adulthood
I'll re-shape myself as if I was made of clay
And if there's hell to pay for the deeds I've done
Gimme consequence tomorrow
But now I'm begging you to stay

I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love

What I've left behind
How many heights I've climbed
Just to make my lovers cry
What was in my mind
And what I got here now

How many hearts I've broken
In the search for my own truth
What I've done to you
How many heights I've climd
In the name of my own pride
What was in my mind
And what I've got here now

Every single day I kneel down and pray
Every single day I look for a way
To reach a highest ground that I haven't found
In the words I'm told by the media lords
In the lies unsold by the global whores
The masters of the wars that they won't fight for
The world I was born

Wants me to think of you

He's got style, he's got flare
Got two left feet but he doesn't care
Dressed in blue, fit to form
Ladies love to touch his uniform
Mess with him and your outta luck
He's a macho duck

Macho macho duck
Oh he's a manly sensation
Macho macho duck
He's a macho macho duck

Can he move, well guess what?
Watch his wiggle waddle strut
But feathers fly when he gets riled
It's like a pillow fight of white

Macho macho duck
The slickest bird in the nation
Macho macho duck

;The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grins?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, of a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind
You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all colors of the wind

Take you far away this time
Baby close your eyes
We're dreamin' on a moonlight shadow
;Why don't you grab it when it goes
That's gonna be wasted time what you really waiting for

Every step you could take on this world
Every thing you should make and you don't
Every time there's a chance to go
Every time there's a smile to show
I wonder why you just say no

Why not (to) bark at the moonlight
Without a break into the night
Why not starting a new fight
And with no chances to survive

Why not running a new car
For us impossible to buy
Why not enjoying your own life
I wonder why you say no why

Why not to lay down on the grass
Why not to smoke it for a rest
You're gonna be all alone what you really waiting for
;Baby when I think of you
I could be your treasure
Your sweet love just if you want me to

Come into my world

;Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now
When did you last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No-one to tell us "no!" or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now for way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

The thrilling chase (a wondrous place)
For you and me...
;They don't have a clue
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two

The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace, the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? (Impossible!)
She'd turn away from me

He's holding back, he's hiding
But why I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace, the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed
;And everybody is out

I want to regain you

For a while woa woa
I've got excited
Open your heart, I can't wait too long for you
Woa woa so get a move on
;I open my eyes like in a trance
Many things happen into your world
Nothing for me then I pray the load

No trains to wait for
No rights to fight for
I want you to be my guiding light
And
Let my brain go boom
Come to my bedroom
I need you to be my superman

Get me burnin' up for your love
Let me get it hot to the core
Like a bomb that explodes in my heart
Right baby right fly me to your star

You're on the wild side not to defiance
I'm on the quiet one not in my plans
I have no fear and nothing to loose
I have no tears for those who like rules
;I will take it and use it
To create a special day
And paint my tomorrow

Wonder if I could climb upon a big tree
Who knows if you see me
Wishing that I could fall down right behind you
And fly away together

It's a miracle, it's invisible
That's illogical superfantastico
It's a mircale, so incredible
So electrical, when she looks at me

And I touch the ground, look for me around
Like a fairy tale, I want her any way
It's a mircale, unbelieveable
That's illogical superfantastico

Till today I couldn't do it
But this the past
Now I know there is a place
Where my dream has come true
;You're free to blow everything we made
All that I need today's your understanding
Yes, it is

Well, there's something else that I can say to you
Hell, you better hear you better listen to

Don't let my love disappear everything you'll be then
Don't let the time do it's work
If you're in that mood you don't know what to do
don't let my love disappear everything you'll decide
Don't let my heart slow its beat
You can think about anyway anyhow

No baby, you don't know you have to learn that

There until the glow of the evening
Sweep me up like the waves and hold me tight in your arms,
Tell me that you love me too.

There until the hush of the evening
Take me up like the tide, I'll always stay by your side,
