Another kiss to you again tomorrow
Hello hello goodbye the future looks so bright
Forget your pain forget your sorrow

Stop me now guess you wonder why
You just sold out the dream inside
Up and down, baby for your lovin'
Baby we can fly up to the sky

Every day, every night crazy for love
Into the depth of desire
Every time, everywhere crazy for love
And now my spirit's on fire

When you find some lovin'
You've got to run away from here
Show me your emotion
Baby make me feel so natural

You are my target
No one ever made me cry
What you do, what you do
Baby's so bad
;I will leave a part of me across the sea

Take your time and tell me if your love is still deep
and strong
I can tell you that my desire is forever
Sleeping with the little pink fluffy bear you
gave to me
I pretend I'm holding you

I wanna keep, I wanna keep it for tonite
I wanna have it when I see the morning light
But if you call, but if you call me to say hi
I'm gonna say goodbye and hold it, hold it tight

I wanna keep, I wanna keep it for tonite
I wanna kiss it 'till I feel the morning light
If you don't call, if you don't call me to say hi
I'll give a kiss goodnight and hold it, hold it tight

Baby wait for me baby stay with me
'Cause you know I need you more need you more

All night on the phone far away from home
Just to send you a kiss again say your name
;I don't want another
Baby you're the one that took a part of me
All the things around me that keep to remind me
Every ittle moment passed next to you

And now there's nothing that I can do
To make you believe in all I say
But if you feel like I feel it's true
Say you wanna come back to me

Every time you go
I'm alone with my desire, I just can't get enough of you
Every time you go
I still burn into the fire, like I lay aside of you
Every time you go
I'm afraid to watch you leaving, I pray to never let you go
Every time you go
When you think I'm only sleeping, I can hear you speaking
Babe I love you

Once upon you told me
That you never hurt me
But I never really kept my faith in you
Now I'm here in crying just coz I was lying
